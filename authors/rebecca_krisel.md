Rebecca Krisel is a doctoral candidate in political science and a Digital Fellow, who uses programming languages (R & Python) to study social questions. Her research focuses on taboo social issues, discourse, and public policy, using Python and R to conduct sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and other forms of text analysis. She has written about the influence of the #MeToo movement on making dance spaces safer for women and LGBTQ communities in New York City. She has also looked at how LGBTQ youth used Zoom and other digital spaces to create virtual dance parties during the height of the pandemic as a way to cope with the alienation of social distancing. Finally, Rebecca's dissertation research focuses on the efforts to decriminalize, medicalize, and/or legalize psychedelic substances in the US.
